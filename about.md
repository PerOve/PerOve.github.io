Hi there!

So you wonder who I am? Here are some hints.

I live and have grown up on the west coast of Norway.
Being outside doing wathever came to mind are fundamentally how my childhood was.
My only worries were monsters in the dark and not be granted access to heaven.
(Of course my family needed to scare us kids with something, for us to behave... :))

Since early childhood I have been very interrested in science and technology.
Luckily for me, our safe and small community has high tech industries like aluminium, ship building and oil and gas companies.
These are depended on very high tech automation solutions, since manpower is rare and unemployment did not exist.

This and my facination for technology got me into studying electronics and automation.
And this again led me into professional information technology, a rising and new way of doing effective work.

And here I am. Still loving what I do.
