I work with business productivity.
The last 7 years that means helping businesses with adopting tools in the Microsoft stack.
SharePoint, Office 365 and Azure are my focus areas.
Before this I have used tools like Lotus Notes, batchfiles, VBA and others.

Automation is my favorite activity. Using PowerShell, SharePoint workflows and Azure Automation.

Nowadays I am learning javascript and TypeScript.
The goal is to be able to create webparts using SharePoint Framework.
And to create APIs to be used as Office 365 connectors.
And to leverage PowerApps, Flow and Power BI to create really fantastic productiviy solutions.

All for the sake of making a difference for businesses and people working there.
